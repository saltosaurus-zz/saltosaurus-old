A Flask-based website using SQLAlchemy to connect to a MySQL database in production.  Version here simply uses a local SQLite3 DB.

Flask is a python microframework found at http://flask.pocoo.org/

The original version of this site was based on Django but I decided this was too much overhead for such a simple site.
The code can be found within the v1-django directory.
